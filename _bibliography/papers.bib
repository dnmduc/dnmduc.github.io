abstract="Image caption generation resides at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, with its primary goal being the creation of descriptive and coherent textual narratives that faithfully depict the content of an image. This paper presents two models that leverage CLIP as the image encoder and fine-tune GPT-2 for caption generation on the Flickr30k and Flickr8k datasets. The first model utilizes a straightforward mapping network and outperforms the original architecture with a BLEU-1 score of 0.700, BLEU-4 score of 0.257, and ROUGE score of 0.569 on the Flickr8k dataset. The second model constitutes a new architecture exploring the boundaries of minimal visual information required for captioning. It incorporates CLIP's text encoder to produce input for the generator, while the image embedding serves solely as a validation mechanism. Despite its relatively lower performance, with a BLEU-1 score of 0.546, BLEU-4 score of 0.108, and ROUGE score of 0.444 on the Flickr8k dataset, this model demonstrates the decoder's ability to create captions based on keyword descriptions alone, without direct access to the context vector.",

abstract="In recent years, along with the increase in private cars, traffic signs have increased in quantity, demanding greater attentiveness from drivers. Many studies have been conducted on Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) to enhance road safety and driver assistance systems by enabling vehicles to autonomously detect and interpret traffic signs, providing crucial information to drivers in real-time. This paper examines various traffic sign detection and classification models, which give practitioners and researchers valuable insights into selecting optimal solutions tailored to the needs of real-world applications. Notably, the investigation highlights YOLOv8 as a leading detection model, displaying exceptional results with an mAP of 99.4{\%}. YOLOv8 provides various model sizes allowing for adaptation to specific real-time processing scenarios. On the other hand, the LeNet model is a standout performer in the classification domain, consistently achieving a remarkable accuracy of 98.2{\%} while using only 0.4 million parameters. The LeNet architecture ensures accurate and rapid traffic sign classification, making it an appealing choice for applications where resource efficiency is critical.",

abstract = {The spider robot is designed to take on challenging tasks in hazardous conditions. It can move across challenging terrain like walls and rough surfaces, and effectively find lost objects. In this paper, an innovative multi-modal control approach was developed for the Surveillance Spider Robot (SSR) application, integrating voice recognition and hand gesture recognition as control commands. SSR, a six-legged robot, was designed using a Raspberry Pi 4B embedded device, Arduino Uno kit, RC Servo motors (MG996R), 18650 batteries, mini USB microphone (MI-350), Pi camera V1 (OV5647) and PWM generator (PCA9685). The robot can be controlled through voice or hand gesture recognition captured via camera and microphone. SSR is capable of performing ten specific tasks based on these control commands, including forward movement, backward movement, left turns, right turns, complete turns, movements with higher or lower centers of gravity, slow movement, body-hopping, and stopping. The performance evaluation of voice and hand gesture recognition suggested that SSR can be used in real-world applications with an accuracy that exceeds 90\% for the ten specific tasks.},

abstract = {In the era of Vietnam’s Industrial Revolution 4.0, technological advancements are crucial, especially in computing and telecommunications. Digital images and videos have become indispensable tools in the modern information age. Human faces hold significant value as biometric identifiers in image and video databases used for surveillance systems. The foundation of model-automated attendance systems utilizing facial recognition is based on taking a face image captured by the camera as input and producing a text recording of the person’s presence. Our study focuses on developing an automatic attendance system based on face recognition using deep learning techniques for real-time recognition. The system includes image capture from a webcam, face detection, dataset management, face recognition, and attendance recording. We investigated and compared three different face recognition models: the VGG-Face model, the Siamese network model, and the Inception-ResNet-v2 model pre-trained. The Siamese Network model achieved the highest accuracy of 94.1\% on the LFW dataset. On the other hand, we also trained this enhanced Siamese Network model on the VN-Celeb dataset specifically for testing on our system to be used for FPT University students - Vietnamese students. This enhanced Siamese Network model is integrated into the system, achieving 94.4\% accuracy on the FPT University student dataset. This system streamlines attendance recording by eliminating the need for manual attendance taking, thereby minimizing human error and saving time.},

This paper introduces SER-Fuse, a multi-modal SER application that is designed to address the complexities of multiple speakers and languages. Our approach leverages diverse audio/speech embeddings and text embeddings to extract optimal features for multi-modal SER. We subsequently employ multi-feature fusion to integrate embedding features across modalities and languages. Experimental results archived on the English-Chinese emotional speech (ECES) dataset reveal that SER-Fuse attains competitive performance in the multi-lingual approach compared to the single-lingual approaches. Furthermore, we provide the implementation of SER-Fuse for download at https://github.com/nhattruongpham/SER-Fuse to support reproducibility and local deployment.},

Therefore, this study presents scenarios to assess the computational capability of edge devices to provide an evaluation of the learning performance of distributed learning methods. It focuses on using Deep Neural Network and the handwritten digit dataset (MNIST) in edge computing to evaluate the performance of distributed learning methods (no-offloading, full-offloading, split computing, and federated computing) in both ideal and realistic conditions. The performance evaluations are based on Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-score, and Estimated time complexity. The findings indicate that the full-offloading method achieved the highest performance in ideal conditions.

abstract="Recent research has shown that multi-modal learning is a successful method for enhancing classification performance by mixing several forms of input, notably in speech-emotion recognition (SER) tasks. However, the difference between the modalities may affect SER performance. To overcome this problem, a novel approach for multi-modal SER called 3M-SER is proposed in this paper. The 3M-SER leverages multi-head attention to fuse information from multiple feature embeddings, including audio and text features. The 3M-SER approach is based on the SERVER approach but includes an additional fusion module that improves the integration of text and audio features, leading to improved classification performance. To further enhance the correlation between the modalities, a LayerNorm is applied to audio features prior to fusion. Our approach achieved an unweighted accuracy (UA) and weighted accuracy (WA) of 79.96{\%} and 80.66{\%}, respectively, on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset. This indicates that the proposed approach is better than SERVER and recent methods with similar approaches. In addition, it highlights the effectiveness of incorporating an extra fusion module in multi-modal learning.",

Therefore, researchers have investigated multi-modalities such as speech, visual, and text inputs to improve the emotional recognition rate of speech. In addition, to enhance the generalized deep learning models for SER, multi-task learning (MTL) strategies have also been applied in the past decade. In this paper, a brief and comprehensive review of multi-modal multi-task learning (3MTL) approaches for recognizing emotional states from speech signals is presented, including multi-modal SER, multi-task learning SER, and multi-modal multi-task learning SER. This paper also discusses about some problems that still need to be solved in 3MTL SER and gives some suggestions for the future.",

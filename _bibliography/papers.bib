abstract = {Recently, speech emotion recognition (SER) has become an active research area in speech processing, particularly with the advent of deep learning (DL). Numerous DL-based methods have been proposed for SER. However, most of the existing DL-based models are complex and require a large amounts of data to achieve a good performance. In this study, a new framework of deep attention-based dilated convolutional-recurrent neural networks coupled with a hybrid data augmentation method was proposed for addressing SER tasks. The hybrid data augmentation method constitutes an upsampling technique for generating more speech data samples based on the traditional and generative adversarial network approaches. By leveraging both convolutional and recurrent neural networks in a dilated form along with an attention mechanism, the proposed DL framework can extract high-level representations from three-dimensional log Mel spectrogram features. Dilated convolutional neural networks acquire larger receptive fields, whereas dilated recurrent neural networks overcome complex dependencies as well as the vanishing and exploding gradient issues. Furthermore, the loss functions are reconfigured by combining the SoftMax loss and the center-based losses to classify various emotional states. The proposed framework was implemented using the Python programming language and the TensorFlow deep learning library. To validate the proposed framework, the EmoDB and ERC benchmark datasets, which are imbalanced and/or small datasets, were employed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods, yielding the highest unweighted recall rates of 88.03 ± 1.39 (%) and 66.56 ± 0.67 (%) for the EmoDB and ERC datasets, respectively.}

abstract = {In content-oriented networks, popular contents are replicated at the intermediate nodes to enhance content delivery performance. Under cooperative caching, the caching nodes collaborate to leverage one another’s cache capability and to reduce the amount of traffic transferring inside the network. This study considers the cooperation among service providers (SPs). The transferable-payoff coalitional game model is applied for analysis. We investigate the stability of the grand coalition and show that the dual-based cost allocation is in the core. A linear program (LP) minimizing the network bandwidth-expense is used for the characteristic function of the game model. However, solving the LP is a challenge because of a large amount of contents in the network. The Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition approach is further applied to decompose the large-scale problem into many subproblems, which can be solved in parallel. The analysis provides not only a deeper insight into the cooperative cache among SPs but also content placement and distribution strategies as a solution to the LP.}

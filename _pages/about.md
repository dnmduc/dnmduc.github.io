I received the B.Eng and M.Eng degrees in Telecommunications Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam, in 2005 and 2007, respectively and the Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering from Kyung Hee University, Korea, in 2014. My research interests include the MAC protocols in Wireless Ad hoc Networks and Vehicular Ad hoc Networks.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
